# Routemaking GUI
The macOS GUI for UBC Sailbot's routemaking component.

## Background
This is the front-end for a process that creates paths around other boats (detected through the Automatic Identification System used on ships) that was used for UBC Sailbot's autonomous sailboat, Ada (see more here https://ubcsailbot.org). I quickly developed this in Newfoundland while our team was preparing to launch Ada on her transatlantic journey to simplify testing of our boat avoidance algorithms. 

## Demo
Here is a short video demonstrating the GUI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AanXgTiSrGo.
